composer require aws/aws-sdk-php
Include Composer Autoloader in your PHP script:

require 'vendor/autoload.php';
Create Guestlist Page: Use the provided template to create guestlist.php and include AWS SDK to fetch and display data from DynamoDB.

Packaging Web App Using Docker
Create Dockerfile in the project directory
dockerfile
Build Docker Image:
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/guestbook-web-app:3.0 .
Push Docker Image to DockerHub:
docker push your-dockerhub-username/guestbook-web-app:3.0
